                The only globally mass-produced yellow banana variety today – the one that you likely picture when you hear the word “banana” – is called the Cavendish. Cavendish bananas have a thick signature-yellow peel when ripe, encasing their soft, cream-colored, semi-starchy flesh. Their flavor can vary, having hints of lemon custard to crème brûlée, as they become sweeter as they ripen. Hence, some people wait to eat them until after their yellow peel becomes flecked with brown. The banana plant itself isn’t a tree, but rather the largest herb in the world. Bananas grow in hanging clusters, called bunches, from these tall plants that can reach over 20 feet tall.
